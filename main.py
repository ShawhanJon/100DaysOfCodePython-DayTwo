#Data Types

#String
#pulling character from string is called subscripting, using []
#numbers in quotes are treated as strings

# print("Hello"[4])

#Integer
#Whole numbers

# print(123 + 345)

#Float
#decimal numbers short for a floating point number

#Boolean
#True or False

###Casting Data types
# num_char = len(input("What's your name? "))
# new_num_char = str(num_char)

# print("Your name has " + new_num_char + " characters.")

## type() gives the type of the object
## str(), float(), int(), etc casts to new type

# a = float(123)
# print(type(a))
# print(70 + float("100.5"))
